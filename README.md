## CS460 at the University of Massachusetts Boston
I would like to dedicate this final project to class CS460.
If you are interested in Computer Graphic and WebGl, please check out this course at https://cs460.org/

## How to run this project?
Clone the repository locally or download directly from GitHub. 
FinalProject.html and wallpaper.png have to come together. 
Run FinalProject.html on local PC.
  - You can click "open" the code directly from your local PC.
  - In case you cannot open it directly, please install the "Live Server" extension and use that to run the code.
