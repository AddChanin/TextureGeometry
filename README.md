## CS460 at the University of Massachusetts Boston
I would like to dedicate this final project for class CS460.
If you are interested in Computer Graphic and WebGl, please check out this course at https://cs460.org/

## How to run this project?
You can click "open" the code directly from your local PC.
In case that you cannot open it directly, please install the "Live Server" extension and use that to run the code.
